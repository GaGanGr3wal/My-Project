# Build INstructions: Temperature Sensor(DS18b20)
## Introduction
The project which I decide to work on is the Temperature Sensor. The motive of this project is to detect the Temperature at various sites. The reason why I chose this project is because I felt like it met all my capabilities. It is an individual project so I worked on it alone but for the software I got two partners Ravneet Singh and Bojan. 

## System Diagram
My temperature sensor will sense the temperature and with the help of raspberry pi it will show the readings of the temperature on the computer screen. You can also use LCD display to show the readings of the temperature.

## Budget
The main components which are required for my project are a raspberry pi, a temperature sensor(DS18B20), jumper wires(male to female). In addition, if you want to show the temperature readings on an LCD you will have to add potentiometers and an LCD display in your budget. These all components are available on Amazon, so you can easily get them. Some other components you will need to make this project are breadboard and a resistor. You can get these components from your parts kit.

If you want to show the readings of temperature on LCD display your budget will increase a bit.

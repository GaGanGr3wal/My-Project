# Build INstructions: Temperature Sensor(DS18b20)
## Introduction
The project which I decide to work on is the Temperature Sensor. The motive of this project is to detect the Temperature at various sites. The reason why I chose this project is because I felt like it met all my capabilities. It is an individual project so I worked on it alone but for the software I got two partners Ravneet Singh and Bojan.

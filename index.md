# Week7
I connected my sensors and i ran the command sudo ./ghmain. My Light sensor is working well but there is a problem in temperature sensor. It is showing the same temperature on all the reading.

# Week5
I am testing my sensors. On 28th november I tested my project sensor but it was not working. I tried to check the pins again with a diagram provided on the web and realised that even though my code was taking an input from pin 29, my sensor was giving the output to pin 31, and i missed that fact because of the close approximity of those two pins. When i realised that, I changed my pin and then my sensor worked well.

# During Strike
The parts which i ordered for my project delivered. I came to college to work on my PCB board.

# Week4
In this week I submitted my Budget. I also start ordering my stuff for the project.
